# About
Here you can find my <del>embarrassing</del> attempts to understand string-processing in C and [Quicksort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort) algorithm.

What this program does is 
1. reads the whole [Eugene Onegin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Onegin) novel (written by one of the greatest Russian writers and poets :candle: Alexander Pushkin) from a file
2. "cleans" the novel (gets rid of empty lines, etc.)
3. generates a new text consisting of sorted lines of the original novel
4. same as the previous one but this time sorts from right to left (this way you can get many sets of rhyming words :smile:)
5. writes all of this to a file or terminal
